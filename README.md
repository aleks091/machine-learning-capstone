## Data acquisition

Kaggle was my starting point for deciding the topic of my capstone project.
Here I reasearched datasets belonging to the medical field, and the Retinal OCT Images piqued my interest.

While Kaggle was a good starting point for this project, it didn't provid the full dataset that I needed to successfully create the benchmark nor the transfer learning models.

Therefore, after researching the internet I found the full dataset in the Mendeley.com website cited below. 


### Kaggle
#### Retinal OCT Images (optical coherence tomography)

### Mendeley
#### Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification
