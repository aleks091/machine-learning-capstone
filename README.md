# CNNs based analysis to predict diagnosis in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans

## Project Structure

This project had to be divided into 2 different jupyter notebooks.
Benchmark.ipynb and InceptionV3.ipynb 

Benchmark.ipynb contains the benchmark model and InceptionV3.ipynb contains the optimized transfer learning model.

## Data acquisition

Kaggle was my starting point for deciding the topic of my capstone project.
Here I reasearched datasets belonging to the medical field, and the Retinal OCT Images piqued my interest.

While Kaggle was a good starting point for this project, it didn't provid the full dataset that I needed to successfully create the benchmark nor the transfer learning models.

Therefore, after researching the internet I found the full dataset in the Mendeley.com website cited below.
